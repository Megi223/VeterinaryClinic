# VeterinaryClinic M&K


## :pencil2: Overview

**VeterinaryClinic** is my defense project for **ASP.NET Core** course at [SoftUni](https://softuni.bg/  "SoftUni") (October-December 2020). It is a website that can represent a vet clinic- its purpose is to inform users about the clinic as well as to connect vets and owners. The website keeps track of pets' health by providing the ability to log all medications and illnesses. Users can also be up-to-date with latest innovations in the world of veterinary medicine by visiting the news page.
